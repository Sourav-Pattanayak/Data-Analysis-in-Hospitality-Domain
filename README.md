🏨 **AtliQ Grands: A Strategic Hospitality Analysis 🌐**

In response to market competition, AtliQ Grands, an imaginary hospitality company with hotels in four cities, embarked on a comprehensive data-driven analysis to overcome challenges and drive business growth.
The project is divided into three major steps:

🧹 **Data Cleaning:**
To ensure accurate insights, I meticulously cleaned the data:
- Fixed negative values in the Number of Guests.
- Removed outliers in Revenue Generated & Realized.
- Handled NaN values in Ratings Given.

🔄 **Data Transformation:**
Turning raw data into actionable insights:
- Introduced 'Occupancy Percentage' using successful bookings and capacity.
- Explored insights based on the transformed data.

📊 **Insights Generated:**
1. 🏢 Presidential rooms boast the highest occupancy rate.
2. 🌆 Delhi leads in occupancy, followed closely by other cities.
3. 📅 Weekends show higher occupancy (>70%) than weekdays (50.9%).
4. 📉 Bangalore consistently has the lowest occupancy rate.
5. 🗓️ August data may be incomplete; only available for Mumbai and Bangalore.

💰 **Revenue Analysis:**
- 📈 Delhi has high occupancy but the least realized revenue.
- 💵 Mumbai records the highest revenue.
- 📊 Total revenue per month peaks in July.

🚀 **Business Insights:**
1.  Bangalore sees a sharp drop in average successful bookings compared to Mumbai.
